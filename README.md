The pump can be defined as it is a mechanical device used to *convert torque* from mechanical hydraulic.
It simply makes possible of fluids movement from one location to another with the help of pressure or suction.

**Electric motors are electromechanical devices mainly used for changing energy from electrical to mechanica.**

This project consists of two stages. First stage, we're manipulating the datasets available and eliminating all incomplete data.
We'll also create a final data-set in which all faulty data is removed as well as Unnecessary data is removed. We name this data-set ***final-data.csv***.

[To access all the data-sets](Data/)

Second stage, here we'll be working on this final data-set and perform analysis. We're basically trying to show that a motor is ***independant*** of all external factors and rather depends on it's ***sensors***.

The Machine Learning processess used are:-
- K-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN)
- Decision Tree

This project is supposed to be :+1: :-
- [x] Finishing ML parts
- [ ] A web interface(Django project)
- [ ] Better GUI format(HTML or Tkinter)
- [ ] User-Friendly
